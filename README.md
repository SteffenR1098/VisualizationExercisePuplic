# VisualizationExercisePuplic
Short Python demonstration of puplic data gathering and visualization

For this exercise, general instructions were given:
1. Find an interesting topic and ask a research question.
2. Find at least two datasets from the web (public access) to visualize and prepare data.
3. Create the visualization (quite simple regarding coding but it had to be a good visualization following Cairo's principles of truthfulness, functionality, beauty and insightfulness).
4. State how you realized Cairo's principles in the visualization.
5. Write a justification of how your visualization addresses your stated research question.
